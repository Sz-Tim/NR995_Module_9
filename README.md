### Module goals
This repository contains various files associated with the Version Control module of Jenica Allen's UNH course "Data Manipulation and Modeling in R" (Fall 2017). The overall goals for the week are for each student to:  
1. Understand the basics of how git works and why scientists should use it
2. Install git on their personal computers
3. Create a GitHub account
4. Connect RStudio with git & GitHub
5. Learn how to use git through RStudio

There are three videos posted to the course website. The first introduces version control generally and describes git more specifically. The second demonstrates the necessary steps to install git, connect with GitHub, and configure RStudio for git integration. The third video illustrates how to create a repository (connected to GitHub remotely and RStudio locally), commit file changes, and push/pull the changes. 

### Repository contents
The slides from the first video as well as outlines of the second and third videos are posted in this repository. You will find the associated RStudio project, R scripts, and the example dataset from the videos in the corresponding subfolders. It also contains the assignments and dataset to be used. Lastly, there is a list of resources to help with any problems you may run into in the future.
