## Useful resources

Git can be confusing. Luckily, there's a large user base. Because git is so popular among software developers and others with a strong background in computer science, it can be intimidating to wade through the help to find what you need. I've listed some resources & tutorials below that were created more for users like us. They review things you've already done, like installation and configuration, and also expand on some of the more basic functions you're likely to find useful. 

Remember: There's no shame in a hard reboot. Sometimes when you're getting started and you can't figure out why all the pieces aren't connected correctly, it's easiest to copy any files to a safe location, delete your borked repository, and start a fresh one.
